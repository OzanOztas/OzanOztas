Hi, I’m @OzanOztas.
I’m studying Mechanical and Process Engnineering at The Technical University of Kaiserslautern.
I'm specializing in Applied Informatics and also looking to get my master's degree in that field.
Currently I'm just trying to get more experience in coding, especially in Python and machine learning.
